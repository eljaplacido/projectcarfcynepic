METHODOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------
  - Causal: DoWhy ATE estimation on synthetic + industry DGPs
    with confounded treatment assignment (logistic propensity).
  - Bayesian: PyMC posterior inference with known ground truth,
    90% HPD coverage, uncertainty decomposition.
  - Router: Cynefin classification on 456-query labeled test set,
    balanced domain sampling, weighted F1 + ECE.
  - Guardian: Deterministic policy enforcement, 5x repetitions.
  - Performance: Latency + tracemalloc memory profiling.
  - Baselines: Raw LLM (same model, no pipeline) for comparison.

EU AI ACT ALIGNMENT
------------------------------------------------------------
  Art. 9  — Risk Management:  Cynefin confidence + uncertainty
  Art. 12 — Record-Keeping:   Kafka audit trail + state persistence
  Art. 13 — Transparency:     Reasoning chain + causal explanations
  Art. 14 — Human Oversight:  Guardian + HumanLayer escalation
