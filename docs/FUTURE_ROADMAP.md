# CYNEPIC Future Roadmap

## Vision
To become the standard open-source architecture for **Epistemic AI Agent** systems—where AI knows what it doesn't know.

---

## Short-Term Goals (v0.6 - v0.8)

### 1. Advanced Simulation Arena
*   **UI Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for constructing Causal Dags in the dashboard.
*   **Batch Mode**: Run 100+ scenarios in parallel (Asyncio optimization).
*   **Export**: Download simulation results as PDF/PPTX reports.

### 2. Federated Causal Learning
*   Enable learning causal structures across multiple deployments (e.g., different factory sites) without sharing raw data.
*   "Federated Graph Learning" module.

### 3. Enhanced "Guardian"
*   **Compliance Templates**: Pre-built OPA policies for GDPR, EU AI Act, and HIPAA.
*   **LLM-as-a-Judge**: Use a separate, stronger LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to grade the reasoning of the primary agent.

---

## Long-Term Vision (v1.0+)

### 1. Neuro-Symbolic Core 2.0
*   Replace standard routing with **Active Inference** loop (Minimize Free Energy).
*   Dynamic resource allocation based on query complexity cost.

### 2. Multi-Modal Context
*   Ingest PDF contracts, Image evidence, and IoT sensor streams into the Epistemic State.
